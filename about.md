I am a software engineer and Jazz musician, currently living in the
Denver, CO area.

My &ldquo;day job&rdquo; has me working on ARM-based embedded system.
Primarily focusing on security.

On my own time, I have a fascinatin with the [Rust][rust] language.
I'm glad to see it getting a lot of interest, as I find it to have an
outstanding set of features.  I have several projects on my
[github][github] page.

As far as Jazz, I play piano.  I've played piano, starting with
classical, since I was about 8, and have been studying jazz since the
mid 2000&lsquo;s.
